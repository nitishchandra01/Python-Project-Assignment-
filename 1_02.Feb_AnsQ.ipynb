    "1Q. Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-> A for loop is typically used when you know the number of times you need to iterate through a block of code. It's useful when you want to execute the same code multiple times with different values. For instance, let's say you have a list of numbers and you want to print out each number in the list. You can use a for loop to iterate over the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, the for loop iterates through the numbers list and assigns each number to the variable num. The print function is then called with num as its argument, printing out each number in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. This type of loop is useful when you don't know in advance how many times you need to iterate through the code. For example, let's say you want to keep adding numbers to a list until the sum of the numbers in the list is greater than 100. You can use a while loop to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = []\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "while total < 100:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    numbers.append(num)\n",
    "    total = sum(numbers)\n",
    "print(numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the while loop keeps prompting the user to enter a number and adding that number to the numbers list until the sum of the numbers in the list is greater than 100. The sum function is used to calculate the total sum of the numbers in the list. Once the condition in the while loop is met, the loop stops and the numbers list is printed out."
